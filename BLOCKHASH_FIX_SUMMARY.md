# 🔧 Blockhash Expiration Fix - Summary

## Problem
You were getting this error on devnet:
```
WalletSignTransactionError: Blockhash is invalid or can not be validated
```

This happens because:
1. Devnet is slower than mainnet
2. Blockhash expires in ~60 seconds (150 blocks)
3. Wallet signing takes time, especially in browser extensions
4. By the time the wallet signs, the blockhash is already expired

## Solutions Implemented

### ✅ Solution 1: Fresh Blockhash with Finalized Commitment
**File**: `src/lib/game/initialize.ts`

```typescript
// Get fresh blockhash RIGHT BEFORE transaction
const { blockhash, lastValidBlockHeight } = await provider.connection.getLatestBlockhash('finalized');

// Use it immediately
const tx = await txBuilder.rpc({
  skipPreflight: true,
  commitment: 'confirmed',
  preflightCommitment: 'confirmed',
});

// Confirm with blockhash context
await provider.connection.confirmTransaction({
  signature: tx,
  blockhash,
  lastValidBlockHeight,
}, 'confirmed');
```

### ✅ Solution 2: Manual Transaction Construction
**File**: `src/lib/game/initialize-with-manual-tx.ts`

This is the **main fix** now being used. It:
1. Gets fresh blockhash with `finalized` commitment
2. Manually constructs the transaction
3. Sets blockhash right before signing
4. Uses `sendRawTransaction` with retry logic
5. Confirms using blockhash context

```typescript
// Get FRESH blockhash
const { blockhash, lastValidBlockHeight } = await provider.connection.getLatestBlockhash('finalized');

// Create transaction manually
const transaction = new Transaction();
transaction.recentBlockhash = blockhash;
transaction.lastValidBlockHeight = lastValidBlockHeight;
transaction.feePayer = provider.wallet.publicKey;
transaction.add(instruction);

// Sign immediately
const signedTx = await provider.wallet.signTransaction(transaction);

// Send with retry
const signature = await provider.connection.sendRawTransaction(
  signedTx.serialize(),
  {
    skipPreflight: true,
    maxRetries: 3,
  }
);

// Confirm with context
await provider.connection.confirmTransaction({
  signature,
  blockhash,
  lastValidBlockHeight,
}, 'confirmed');
```

### ✅ Solution 3: Connection Pre-warming
**File**: `src/hooks/useCreateGame.ts`

```typescript
// Pre-warm connection to cache blockhash
const warmupBlockhash = await connection.getLatestBlockhash('finalized');
```

### ✅ Solution 4: Optimized Provider Settings
```typescript
const provider = new AnchorProvider(
  connection,
  anchorWallet,
  { 
    commitment: 'confirmed',
    preflightCommitment: 'confirmed',
    skipPreflight: true,  // Skip preflight checks
    maxRetries: 3,        // Retry on failure
  }
);
```

### ✅ Solution 5: Account Fetch Retry Logic
```typescript
// Retry fetching game account with delays
let game = null;
let retries = 5;
while (retries > 0) {
  try {
    game = await ProgramClient.fetchGame(gamePDA);
    if (game) break;
  } catch (e) {
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
  }
  retries--;
}
```

### ✅ Solution 6: Balance Check
```typescript
// Check if user has enough SOL
const balance = await connection.getBalance(wallet.publicKey);
if (balance < 10_000_000) {
  throw new Error('Insufficient balance. Get devnet SOL from https://faucet.solana.com');
}
```

## Why This Works

1. **Finalized Commitment**: More stable than 'processed' or 'confirmed'
2. **Fresh Blockhash**: Get it right before signing, not earlier
3. **Manual Construction**: Full control over transaction timing
4. **Skip Preflight**: Avoid double-validation that can fail
5. **Retry Logic**: Handle network hiccups
6. **Blockhash Context**: Proper confirmation with block height

## Testing the Fix

1. **Clear browser console**
2. **Connect wallet** (make sure you have devnet SOL)
3. **Create a game** - you should now see:
   ```
   🔥 Getting FRESH blockhash with finalized commitment...
   ✅ Fresh blockhash: [hash]
   ✅ Valid until block: [height]
   📝 Creating transaction manually...
   ✍️ Requesting wallet signature...
   ✅ Transaction signed
   📤 Sending raw transaction...
   ✅ Transaction sent: [signature]
   ⏳ Confirming transaction...
   ✅ Transaction confirmed!
   ```

## Alternative: If Still Failing

If you still have issues, try:

1. **Use a different RPC endpoint**:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_ENDPOINT=https://api.devnet.solana.com
   ```

2. **Increase timeout** in `.env`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_TRANSACTION_TIMEOUT_MS=120000
   ```

3. **Use 'processed' commitment** (faster but less safe):
   ```typescript
   getLatestBlockhash('processed')
   ```

4. **Clear wallet cache** - Sometimes browser wallet extensions cache old data

5. **Get fresh devnet SOL**:
   ```bash
   solana airdrop 2 YOUR_ADDRESS --url devnet
   ```
   Or use: https://faucet.solana.com

## Files Changed

1. ✅ `src/lib/game/initialize.ts` - Updated blockhash handling
2. ✅ `src/lib/game/initialize-with-manual-tx.ts` - **NEW** Manual transaction builder
3. ✅ `src/hooks/useCreateGame.ts` - Use manual transaction approach
4. ✅ Balance checking and better error messages

## Expected Result

Your game creation should now work on devnet! You'll see:
- ✅ Fresh blockhash obtained
- ✅ Transaction signed quickly
- ✅ Transaction sent successfully
- ✅ Transaction confirmed
- ✅ Game account created
- 🔗 Explorer link with transaction

## Need More Help?

If this still doesn't work:
1. Check your wallet has devnet SOL
2. Try a different RPC endpoint
3. Check devnet status: https://status.solana.com
4. Try in incognito mode (fresh wallet state)
5. Share the full console logs for debugging

**This is a devnet-specific issue. On mainnet, this problem is much less common due to higher network performance!**
