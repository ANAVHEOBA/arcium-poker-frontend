## 🔧 Technical Details

### Smart Contract Instructions Used:
- `player_action` - Unified action handler with variants:
  - `{ fold: {} }`
  - `{ check: {} }`
  - `{ call: {} }`
  - `{ bet: { amount: BN } }`
  - `{ raise: { amount: BN } }`
  - `{ allIn: {} }`

### Action Validation:
- ✅ Checks if it's player's turn
- ✅ Validates chip stack sufficiency
- ✅ Enforces minimum raise amounts
- ✅ Prevents invalid actions (e.g., check when there's a bet)

### Auto-Refresh:
- Refreshes every 3 seconds during active games
- Only runs when `stage !== waiting` and `stage !== finished`
- Automatically cleans up interval on unmount

## 🎯 What's Next

### To Complete Full Poker Flow:
1. **Advance Stage** - Move from PreFlop → Flop → Turn → River
2. **Showdown** - Reveal cards and determine winner
3. **Payout** - Distribute pot to winner
4. **New Hand** - Start next hand

### Future Enhancements:
- Card reveal/decryption via Arcium MPC
