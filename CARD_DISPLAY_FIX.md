# Card Display Fix Summary

## Issue
The poker game UI was not displaying actual card values - only showing lock icons ðŸ”’ and question marks for community cards.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Card Decoding Utilities (`src/lib/cards/deck.ts`)
Added three new helper methods to `DeckManager` class:

- **`getCardDisplayFromIndex(index: number)`** - Converts card index (0-51) to display string (e.g., "Aâ™ ")
- **`getCardColorFromIndex(index: number)`** - Returns 'red' or 'black' for proper styling
- **`getCardInfoFromIndex(index: number)`** - Returns full card object with display properties

### 2. Updated PlayerHoleCards Component (`src/components/game/PlayerHoleCards.tsx`)
- Added `showRevealed` prop to control when cards are visible
- Cards now decode from indices and display actual values at showdown
- Cards show as locked ðŸ”’ during play, revealed at showdown/finished
- Proper color styling (red for hearts/diamonds, black for clubs/spades)

### 3. Updated Game Page (`src/app/game/[gamePDA]/page.tsx`)
- Import `DeckManager` for card decoding
- Pass `showRevealed={game?.stage?.showdown || game?.stage?.finished}` to PlayerHoleCards
- Community cards now decode indices to actual card displays with proper colors

## Card Index Mapping
Cards are encoded as indices 0-51:
- 0-12: Hearts (2â™¥ to Aâ™¥)
- 13-25: Diamonds (2â™¦ to Aâ™¦)
- 26-38: Clubs (2â™£ to Aâ™£)
- 39-51: Spades (2â™  to Aâ™ )

## Known Issue: All Cards Show as 2â™¥

Looking at the debug data from your game:
```json
"communityCards": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
"communityCardsRevealed": 5,
"deckInitialized": true
```

All cards have index 0, which decodes to 2â™¥. This indicates one of two issues:

### Possible Causes:
1. **Deck Not Properly Shuffled**: The `encrypted_indices` in the deck might all be zeros
2. **Advance Stage Not Called**: The game might have jumped to showdown without properly calling `advance_stage` between betting rounds (PreFlop â†’ Flop â†’ Turn â†’ River)

### To Verify:
Check if `advance_stage` was called during the game flow:
- After PreFlop betting â†’ Should reveal 3 cards (Flop)
- After Flop betting â†’ Should reveal 1 card (Turn)  
- After Turn betting â†’ Should reveal 1 card (River)
- After River betting â†’ Move to Showdown

### Testing in a New Game:
1. Start a fresh game with proper deck shuffling
2. Make sure to click "Next Stage" button after each betting round
3. Verify cards are properly revealed at each stage

- `/home/a/arcium-poker-frontend/src/components/game/PlayerHoleCards.tsx`
- `/home/a/arcium-poker-frontend/src/app/game/[gamePDA]/page.tsx`

## Result
Cards now display properly in the UI! However, you'll need to ensure:
1. The MPC shuffle properly initializes the deck with random card indices
2. `advance_stage` is called between each betting round to reveal community cards
